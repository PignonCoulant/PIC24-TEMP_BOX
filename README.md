This project is more or less an idea to get used to stofware managment of oled display, multiplexing for seven segment display and know how to use PIC24 microcontroller. 

It's uses for many things as temperature reader, humidity reader, pressure reader, stop watch, timer, uart communication and other thing that I didn't think about yet. I usually code drivers myself based on the datasheet, and not rely an external libraries.

The project is to take as it but you may find few thing to use for your own code.
